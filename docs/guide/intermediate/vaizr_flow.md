# Flow

This is a bit like the hooks page, but instead of looking at creating a screen from a hook to hook basis, here we look at the more global creation.
So for example, the screenfields will be mentioned.

Something like, handler, what it does, like the result list, and also showdialog.
Then the show dialog, and what that does.
Also information on why/how the selectedRecord exists, and the master record. How from selectedRecords you go to a single selected one. Those kind of informations.
Also, for more information on the [hooks](hooks).
